<div style="text-align: right;font-style: italic;">
Advancing Texas Subsidence Information Through Data Integration and Collaborative Science
</div>

The creation of a centralized storage allocation with API access to streamline data federation between cataloged subsidence data collections and registered data from other sources. The data collection services will focus on making subsidence data collections discoverable with the goal of providing informational resources for various evaluations and decisions made by potential end-users. The design for prototype services will consider an architecture that enables data ingest and storage with metadata and data formatting guidelines.
