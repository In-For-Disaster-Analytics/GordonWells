## [DOLCE: Digital Object Life Cycle Ecosystem  Data Management](dolce.md)
Classification, Categorization & Ingest of Digital Objects and Metadata at scale

### Digital Object Capture
- [Sites and Stories](https://sitestories.io/portal/home/index.html) for unstructured data
- Spatial Surveying (link to something RE survey 123 stuff here)
- UPstream Sensor Database (upstream-dso.tacc.utexas.edu) for structured data


### Digital Object Registration
- [REDI Metadata Explorer Ingest and Register](https://ms2-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/metadata_app/) - This is the entry point for loading and registering data and data resources in the REDI solutions ecosystem.
- [Metadata and Data layer ingest - Complete metadata model](https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/04ec954ca2e5469b8026c28cb17afa48?portalUrl=https://sitestories.io/portal)
  - [Embedded ingest for attachments 6G or less](https://ms2-dev.tacc.utexas.edu/survey-attachments)
- [Model Catalog Service](https://tacc.mint.isi.edu/any/models/explore) 

### Digital Object Discovery
- [REDI Data Discovery Services](http://ckan-kmp-setx.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/)

## [DYNAMO](dynamo.md) - Dynamic Analyses and Modeling
Model Integration as a Service! Dynamo is a dynamic modelling modelling platform that allows modelers to leverage HPC to facilitate running models

- [PTDataX](https://ptdatax.tacc.utexas.edu/)
- MIC and PTDataX Model Registry
- [Cookbook Catalog](https://ptdatax.tacc.utexas.edu/workbench/applications/jupyter-lab-llama-ls6)
- MEEP 

## [Sociotechnical Digital Twins](digital-twins.md) 
Digital Twins are poised to revolutionize simulations. The REDI team is developing tools that streamline the creation and orchestration of Digital Twins using physics-based information to support participatory processes

### Digital Twin Ready Data and Services
- Terrain Tile Service. DEM coverages processed from best available LIDAR data.  
- [Spatial Visualization](https://sitestories.io/ecq/)
- [DT Transformation and Composition Platform](https://tacc.mint.isi.edu/). Tools and applications to support the creation and orchestration of digital twin analyses.
