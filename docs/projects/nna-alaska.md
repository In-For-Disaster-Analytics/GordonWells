# Alaskan Yukon

## Description
One of the Sites explored by this project is the Yukon Delta in Alaska through the Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) initiative. This project addresses key challenges for remote communities in Alaska which impact the nation's economy, security, and resilience. This project focuses on improving water infrastructure in rural Arctic areas by bridging the gap between engineering knowledge and local expertise. It employs an interdisciplinary approach in three phases to develop practical OMM resources grounded in local knowledge. The phases combine civil and environmental engineering, sociology, anthropology, and human-computer interaction to yield a multidisciplinary and multifaceted appraisal of the socio-environmental challenges in these communities.
