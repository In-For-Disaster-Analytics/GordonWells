# SETx

## Description: 
Create the core infrastructure and templates for a reusable Knowledge Management Platform. Research and develop scalable decision support and deep uncertainty cybertools.
How: 
Collaborate with research team to design and implement services that support data and model management and extend CI and DSS approaches that will be sustained via leveraged efforts with other initiatives, like TDIS, DOLCE, MINT, etc.
Research Focus (RF's) to develop advanced decision support tools that address:
* RF1 - knowledge capture for sensed and unstructured information, 
* RF2 – develop reusable analytical methods that use natural language processing to computationally deconstruct problem formulations and link data/models with decision problems.
* RF3 – explore and design methods and utilities that support a standardized use of methods for decision making under deep uncertainty.
Implementation Science to support stakeholder community needs and act as a learning laboratory for Intelligent Systems and IFL researchers
