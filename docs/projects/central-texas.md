## Description
The Smart & Connected Communities project focuses on improving resilience in communities facing extreme weather events and chronic stressors. It aims to create a secure online portal where residents can share their local knowledge about these challenges. Researchers will work with the community to integrate this local knowledge with existing data sets used for planning and disaster preparation. The project not only enhances community resilience but also contributes to the national interest by providing a model that other communities can adapt. It involves creating innovative tools, data privacy processes, and knowledge integration frameworks, promoting local expertise in decision-making, and enhancing computer-based modeling for better resilience and preparedness.
