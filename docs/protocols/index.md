## Unmanned Aerial Drone Operations

Our research used unmanned aerial drone operations for surveying. A full writeup of our protocols and lessons learned is available for our field session in [Fort Davis, Texas in March, 2023](../field-sessions/fort-davis-march-23/drone.md).  

A more generalized set of protocols for this work will be published in this section soon.

## Hand-held LiDAR data acquisition using Geoslam

Our research uses a hand-held GeoSLAM to collect ground level LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data.  A full writeup of our protocols and lessons learned is available for our field session in [Fort Davis, Texas in March, 2023](../field-sessions/fort-davis-march-23/lidar.md).  


A more generalized set of protocols for this work will be published in this section soon.

## [Spatial Surveying / Interview data](survey123_user.md)

Spatial interview data is collected using custom survey templates produced with ArcGIS Survey123 software.  Visit the **Spatial Surveys** page for instructions on standing up a research survey on REDI systems.
