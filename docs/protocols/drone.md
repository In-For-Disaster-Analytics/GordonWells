Our research used unmanned aerial drone operations for surveying. A full writeup of our protocols and lessons learned is available for our field session in [Fort Davis, Texas in March, 2023](../field-sessions/fort-davis-march-23/drone.md).


A more generalized set of protocols for this work will be published in this section soon.
