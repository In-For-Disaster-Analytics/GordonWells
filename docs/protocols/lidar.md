# Hand-held LiDAR data acquisition using Geoslam

Our research uses a hand-held GeoSLAM to collect ground level LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data.  A full writeup of our protocols and lessons learned is available for our field session in [Fort Davis, Texas in March, 2023](../field-sessions/fort-davis-march-23/lidar.md).


A more generalized set of protocols for this work will be published in this section soon.
