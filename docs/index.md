Advancing Texas Subsidence Information Through Data Integration and Collaborative Science
</div>

SUBSIDE is a comprehensive data management and analysis platform developed through collaboration between the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) and The University of Texas at Austin. The system provides centralized access to subsidence data collections across Texas, integrating diverse monitoring technologies including InSAR satellite imagery, GPS measurements, groundwater observations, models, reusable analysis tools, and extensometer data.  

SUBSIDE enables users to discover, analyze, and understand land subsidence patterns to support informed decision-making for water resource management, infrastructure planning, and hazard mitigation.
