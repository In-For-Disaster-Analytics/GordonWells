# Subsidence Data Management and Analytics Services  
The creation of a centralized storage allocation with API access to streamline data federation between cataloged subsidence data collections and registered data from other sources. The data collection services will focus on making subsidence data collections discoverable with the goal of providing informational resources for various evaluations and decisions made by potential end-users. The design for prototype services will consider an architecture that enables data ingest and storage with metadata and data formatting guidelines. 

**Getting Started with SUBSIDE Data Discovery**
The Data Discovery service provides searchable access to subsidence-related datasets for Texas and the Gulf Coast region. You can:
- Search by location, date range, or keyword
- Preview datasets directly in your browser
- Download data in multiple formats
- Access metadata and data quality documentation
- View interactive maps and visualizations

**About Organizations and Groups**
_Why are there different sets of information in the SUBSIDE Organization and SUBSIDE Group?_
SUBSIDE data discovery services are managed using a CKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network) platform, which organizes data into two complementary categories to help users find relevant information efficiently.

**SUBSIDE Organization** includes datasets that are officially managed and produced by SUBSIDE project team members, including the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and The University of Texas at Arlington. These datasets represent authoritative, project-vetted resources with documented provenance and quality assurance.

**SUBSIDE Group** provides a broader collection that encompasses datasets potentially useful to the **subsidence** stakeholder community. This includes both SUBSIDE-managed datasets and relevant external data sources such as historical surveys, regional geology, hydrological data, and other complementary information. The Group view is designed to serve researchers and practitioners who need a comprehensive catalog of subsidence-related data beyond the core SUBSIDE products.
